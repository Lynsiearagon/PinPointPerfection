Rev rate and ball speed affect the way the ball hooks. 
There are various combos of rev rate and ball speed.

For the basic release of this app, rev rate and ball speed will
play little part in calculating the suggested bowling ball. 
As the app continues to develop, I will implement an algo that factors 
in rev rate and ball speed. 6/22/2023
