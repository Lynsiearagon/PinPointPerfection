# PinPoint Perfection

## Background
    
PinPoint Perfection is a bowling application tool that can be used by both novice and experienced bowlers.
This application generates bowling ball recommendations by analyzing an oil pattern that a bowler has selected, 
two simple bowler attributes, and the bowling balls listed in the bowler's current arsenal.

To generate a recommendation, a bowler will take a few easy-to-follow-steps, click submit, and instantly receive their bowling ball recommendation for their selected oil pattern. If a bowler wishes to see other options, they simply need to click the arrows on the resulting bowling ball image.


## Functionality and MVPs

In PinPoint Perfection, users will be able to: 
- Search a dropdown menu for a desired oil pattern and pattern specs
- Add a list of bowling balls to their arsenal through search and auto fill option 
- Delete bowling balls from their arsenal 
- Scroll left and right through arsenal list 
- Submit inputted information for customized bowling ball recommendation 
- Receive customized bowling ball recommendation 
- Click through recommendations 

### In addition, this project will include:
- About the app section 
- Step by step user instructions
- Must press browser "refresh" button to clear or reset recommendation if recommendation has been generated 
- README.md
   
## Future functionality
- Option for bowler to record scores on specified oil pattern with recommended ball
